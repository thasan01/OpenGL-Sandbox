# OpenGL-Sandbox

##Motivation
Learning OpenGL is difficult. Whether you are new to graphics programming, or you worked with OpenGL in the past, but haven't used it in a long time, the inital setup is the most time consuming part. This project aims to provide an easy way to set up OpenGL projects, so you can focus on the interesting stuff.

##Setup
TODO: Add steps.
